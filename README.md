### Module 1:
**Video 1:** In this lesson, I learned why LangGraph is useful when building more complex LLM applications. Rather than having to work with straightforward, linear chains, LangGraph allows you to construct dynamic, graph-based workflows with loops, branching, and shared state. This greatly simplifies being able to construct agent-like systems that can make decisions, invoke tools, and evolve as they execute. It also helps with debugging and scaling by giving better visibility into how the flow is working.

**Tweaking:** There was no code provided for this video â€” it mainly covered the basics and introductory concepts, so there was no tweaking or hands-on implementation to document for this lesson.
